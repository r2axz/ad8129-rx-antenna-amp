# ad8129 RX Antenna Amp

This repository offers a KiCad project for DL2KQ high CMRR receiving antenna
amplifier. The amplifier is designed to work with magnetic loop, flag, ferrite
rod, and similar antennas. IIgor DL2KQ Goncharenko developed the original
circuit, which I left pretty much unchanged, except I added a couple of extra
capacitors for power supply and varactor bias decoupling. Refer to the original
post (in Russian) [http://dl2kq.de/ant/3-96.htm](http://dl2kq.de/ant/3-96.htm)
